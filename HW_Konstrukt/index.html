                React Native is an open source framework for building Android
                and iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
                capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and
                behavior of your UI using React components:

                  bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about
                  React in the next section</span
                >. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                React fundamentals
                <sup class="heading-sup">Chapter 3</sup>
              </h2>

              <p>
                React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a
                popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
                understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
                serve as a refresher course.
              </p>

              <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

              <p>
                <span class="bold">+ components.</span>
                The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a
                cafe to work in.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="bold">+ JSX.</span>
                React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <span class="highlight"
                  >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                The React docs have
                <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you
                can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
                use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                <span class="highlight">name</span> for the cat, name, and
                embedding it with curly braces inside
                <span class="highlight">&lt;Text&gt; &lt;/Text&gt;</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="bold">+ props.</span>
                Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="bold">+ state.</span>
                While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data
                storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your
                components memory!
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section" id="text-input">
              <h2 class="heading">
                handling text input
                <sup class="heading-sup">Chapter 4</sup>
              </h2>
              <p>
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter
                text. It has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop
                that takes a function to be called every time the text changed,
                and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called
                when the text is submitted.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're
                translating their words into a different language. In this new
                language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
                sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
